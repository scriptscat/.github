ScriptCat is a browser extension that can execute userscripts, which, compared to Tampermonkey scripts, provides a framework for running background scripts and offers more APIs.

We are committed to promoting and developing more powerful and user-friendly userscripts, hoping that everyone can benefit from them. We not only have comprehensive learning materials, but also an active community that you can join through the following links.

### ScriptCat Ecosystem

ScriptCat is more than just a browser extension; it includes the ScriptCat browser extension, ScriptCat script station, and Tampermonkey Chinese Network, among other components.

Additionally, ScriptCat provides a framework for running background scripts, which means you can run scripts in the background without opening web pages. We are currently actively developing towards the cloud.
